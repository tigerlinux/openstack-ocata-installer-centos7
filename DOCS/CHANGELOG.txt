1.2.2.el7 - October 17, 2017

- Added missing nova-placement port on firewall master
  script.
- Updated cinder-services sequence on openstack-control.sh
  script.

1.2.1.el7 - October 09, 2017

- Added temporary fix for Horizon "internal error"
  caused by some updated package on Centos 7.4.
  Note that while we could not determine the exact
  package causing the problem, we could apply a
  very effective fix. This fix is, again, temporary.
  When either Centos people or RDO people fix the
  problem, we'll remove the temporary fix.

1.2.0.el7 - August 24, 2017

- Completely reworked security model.
- Added extra variables on the main-config.rc file
  used to fine-tune iptables rules applied to the
  openstack server.
- Added new variables on the main-config.rc file used
  to fine-tune workers on most openstack modules.

1.1.6.el7 - August 01, 2017

- Changed (again) database installation secuence in
  order to make it more fool-proof on several host
  configurations.

1.1.5.el7 - July 28, 2017

- Changed some entries in database installation module
  in order to make it more "fool-proof".

1.1.4.el7 - July 20, 2017

- Added extra checks for openstack-control.sh script in
  order to allow apache to survice when a stop/restart
  is sent to specific services using mod_wsgi if keystone
  is installed and serving using apache.
- Added new "systemd" service (and documented in the main
  readme) used to allow correct boot of all openstack
  services at boot-time using openstack-control.sh. With
  this, it is no longer needed to include anything extra
  on rc.local.
- Added some extra packages to the requirements module.

1.1.3.el7 - June 06, 2017

- Added extra code in database installation. This
  new code ensure proper file descriptor settings
  for mariadb.

1.1.2.el7 - April 06, 2017

- Extra configurations added in order to make
  interactions between cinder and nova more fool-
  proof.
- Added Cinder endpoints for V3 (volumev3).
- Added extra configuration items for more control
  in how to delete volumes in Cinder (see main
  config).

1.1.1.el7 - March 31, 2017

- Included new variable "tenant_network_types" (set
  by default to "gre") to add more control to neutron
  installation module.
- Added extra information regarding trove and magnum
  requirements on the main readme and into the main
  configuration file.
- Added FIX for missing kubernetes python libraries in
  magnum install module.

1.1.0.el7 - March 27, 2017

- Included Magnum (Container infrastructure as a
  Service) install option.
- General typo fixes.

1.0.2.el7 - March 25, 2017

- Bugfix: Removed some leftovers regarding glusterfs
  support in cinder.

1.0.1.el7 - March 25, 2017

- Fully removed glusterfs cinder volume backend option.
  The driver was deprecated (but still available) on
  Newton release, but completelly removed on Ocata.
- Added snapshoot and qcow support on our implementation
  of the NFS driver on Cinder.

1.0.0.el7 - March 24, 2017

- All modules adapted to OpenStack Rel 15 "Ocata".
- MongoDB fully deprecated in favor of GNOCCHI. All
  needed configurations and installation actions are
  performed by ceilometer install module, which also
  installs and configure gnocchi.
- As a result of gnocchi introduction, all metric re-
  lated functions are performed by gnocchi. This also
  include client interactions, that need to be per-
  formed using openstack client instead of old ceilo-
  metet client.
- Because we are using gnocchi now, ceilometer end-
  points in keystone are no longer needed (so they are
  not created). Also, the ceilometer-api is not con-
  figured either. All metric and events are now con-
  sumed trough gnocchi and aodh clients using the
  python openstack cli.
- CELLS setup included in the installer. Because now
  cell setup is "mandatory" for nova, our installer
  takes the apropiate steps to install and configure
  all needed support, including the new cell db.
- New placement api included in nova setup. The API is
  served trough a WSGI using apache.
- Some API's are using apache now (trough wsgi). Those
  include:
  * aodh-api.
  * placement-api (part of nova now).
  * cinder-api (only in Ubuntu based installs).
  * gnocchi-api.
- Designate install module adjusted to use the worker/
  producer model.
