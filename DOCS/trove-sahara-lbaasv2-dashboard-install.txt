The actual "openstack dashboard" packages in Ubuntu and Centos (for Newton release)
does not contains all the panels for the non-core projects. Also the "lbaasv2" panel
is missing from Ubuntu 1604lts. Fortunatelly, those panels are very easy to install.
Follow the next procedures in order to install them in the horizon machine 
(normally, the controller or all-in-one openstack server):

cp /usr/local/src/designate-dashboard/designatedashboard/enabled/* /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/
cd /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/

INSTRUCTIONS FOR UBUNTU 16.04LTS BASED OPENSTACK NEWTON DASHBOARD PANELS (MANILA, AND LBAASV2):

LBAASV2 Neutron Panels:

apt-get install -y git python-pip

git checkout stable/newton
pip install -e ./
cp /usr/local/src/neutron-lbaas-dashboard/neutron_lbaas_dashboard/enabled/_1481_* /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/

cd /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/
python manage.py compress --force
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

NOTE: The packaged version of the manila-ui seems to be broken. The git version is
working OK though.


FINAL NOTES:

Only intall those extra panels if you have the relevant components installed (mean, do 
not install them if you don't have manila, designate, or neutron installed).

If your dashboard stop working properlly after installing those dashboard's, you will have
to apply the "COMPRESS_OFFLINE = False" workaround described in the following files inside
the DOCS directory of our installer:
